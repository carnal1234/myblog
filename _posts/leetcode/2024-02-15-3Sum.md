[15. 3Sum](https://leetcode.com/problems/3sum/)

Given an integer array nums, return all the triplets [nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]] such that i != j, i != k, and j != k, and nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0.

Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.




The Idea is similar to 2Sum for extra loop.

1st Sort nums in ascending order
2nd Build hashed map

3rd Start index from 0 to nums.length - 2
  - Skipped positive value as it is impossible to get sum of 0 for positive value
  - Inner loop for i + 1 to nums.length - 1 
  - Skipped duplicate duple
  - Skipped duplicated nums by hashed map




```js
var threeSum = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a,b) => a-b) //sort nums 

    if(nums[0] > 0) return [] //if first element > 0 for sorted nums, it is impossible to get any answer

    //Construct hashed Map by last occurence
    let hashMap = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        hashMap.set(nums[i], i);
    }
    //For sorted nums,  fix first value as negative, then find two duple that add up to the - first value

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; ++i) { //Loop through nums 
        if (nums[i] > 0) { //If element > 0, no need to continue as it is sorted
            break;
        }
        
        for (let j = i + 1; j < nums.length - 1; ++j) {
            let required = -1 * (nums[i] + nums[j]); //add up two nums, then search in hashed map
            if (hashMap.has(required) && hashMap.get(required) > j) { //Skip previously searched result
                answer.push([nums[i], nums[j], required]);
            }
            j = hashMap.get(nums[j]); //Skip to last occurence of i
        }
        
        i = hashMap.get(nums[i]); //Skip to last occurence of i
    }


    
    return answer;
};



```
